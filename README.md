# Stockholm-book-club
Stockholm book club is exactly what it sounds like, it is a book club based in Stockholm. Made by and for people who loves to read and wants to make a deep dive in captivating classics, by discussing and debating the books context.

To make the book club accessible to as many people as possible, the meetups are held in central Stockholm at the same café and the same time every week. It is also very easy to join, all you need to do is to sign up using the sign up form and show up at the next meeting.

## Features

### Navigation bar
* The navigation bar includes a logo that links to the home page, a link to the home page, a link to the book list and a link to the signup page. The navigation bar looks the same on every page to allow for easy navigation and good UX.

* The Navigation bar is responsive, so when the website is used by a phone the navigation will have a dropdown menu with links to all the pages.

### Landing page
* The landing page includes a image with text overlay that tells the user when and where the meetings are held. The text also contains a link to google maps that opens in a new tab so the user easily can see the location of the café that the meetings are held.

* Under the landing page image will the user see a section containing why they should join this book club, and a link to the sign up page.

### Footer
* The footer contains links to social media pages that opens in separate tabs for good UX.

* The links to social media makes it easy for the user to find the club on every social media.

### Book list page
* This page contains a background image of a open book.

* The page also contains a list that goes from January to December, telling the user which book the club are reading every month and which author made the book.

### Sign up page
* On this page the user will see a background image.

* Overlaying the background image the user will see a sign up form that allows the user to join the book club by submitting their first name, last name and email address.

### Features to add
* One feature that I want to add is a protocol page where the user easily can read what the club where discussing prior meetings or even listen to an audio recording form the prior meetings.

# Stockholm-book-club
Stockholm book club is exactly what it sounds like, it is a book club based in Stockholm. Made by and for people who loves to read and wants to make a deep dive in captivating classics, by discussing and debating the books context.

To make the book club accessible to as many people as possible, the meetups are held in central Stockholm at the same café and the same time every week. It is also very easy to join, all you need to do is to sign up using the sign up form and show up at the next meeting.

## Features

### Navigation bar
* The navigation bar includes a logo that links to the home page, a link to the home page, a link to the book list and a link to the signup page. The navigation bar looks the same on every page to allow for easy navigation and good UX.

* The Navigation bar is responsive, so when the website is used by a phone the navigation will have a dropdown menu with links to all the pages.

### Landing page
* The landing page includes a image with text overlay that tells the user when and where the meetings are held. The text also contains a link to google maps that opens in a new tab so the user easily can see the location of the café that the meetings are held.

### Features to add
* One feature that I want to add is a protocol page where the user easily can read what the club where discussing prior meetings or even listen to an audio recording form the prior meetings.

## Wireframe
* For wireframing I used Figma and I kept it very basic, but I think it does a good job of showing the kind of layout I was going for.

## Testing
* The website have been tested on multiple browsers and on multiple screen-sizes.

* All the links work and the links that should open in a separate tab does.

### Bugs
* I had a bug in the deployed version, the background images didn't work but I fixed that by changing the file pathway.
